 *  YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO MODIFY THIS CLASS TO MAKE YOUR SYSTEM WORK.
 *  (Since you will only submit on Moodle two files: DataFrame.java and NetworkCard.java)
 *  
 *  Although you SHOULD modify this class to see if your ARQ protocol is working when
 *  noise is added to the wire (see below for how to do this).
 *  Also you may wish to modify it to test other features of the system such as its
 *  ability to transmit sentinel and escape characters as data values in the payload.

/**
 * 
 * This is a test which joins two network cards together with a wire pair.
 * It then sends a data frame across the network from Network Card 1 to
 * Network Card 2.
 * 
 * An oscilloscope is also connected to the wire to allow the voltage levels
 * to be monitored over time.
 * 
 * A source for thermal noise can also be connected to the wire which simulates
 * noise on the network to see how robust the transmission process is to noise.
